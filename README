This is the trained network for performing automated N-Label replacements in
Applied Biosystems (AB1) tracefiles from Sanger Sequencing.

Basecalls emitted using the KB algorithm have an associated quality value --
those basecalls marked with a QV < 20 indicate a p(error) > 1%.

This software reads ab1 files, and replaces a subset of the N-labels with
discrete basecalls only if its own internal estimation of error is below 0.8%;

In my validation, this results in an observed error rate below 1%;
On average, validation data contained 14 N-labels per tracefile,
of which seven N-labels are recovered.
The other seven generally produce rates of error higher than 1%,
and are usually ignored by S3.

The training and validation of this system is described in:
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7542173

This software was developed, tested, and evaluated for downstream bioinformatics
impact and DNA Barcoding applications in my PhD thesis.


=== BUILDING ==

-- Requires: Python 2.7 with Cython 0.27
-- Do "make" to build the c-based Cython modules.


== RUNNING ==

$ python S3CommandLine.py someAbiFile.ab1


== OUTPUT ==

A json file is printed to stdout, with the following structure:
